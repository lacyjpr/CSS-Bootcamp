CSS Bootcamp!!!

Jan 31 - Feb 28 2020 & Onward!

Rules: No Frameworks. HTML, JS & CSS only.

You can do the themes in any order you like.

You can add a build step if you want to do minification, optimization and the like, and include a package.json with run and build and whatnot if you want to use webpack live server during development.

You don’t have to exactly clone the theme, you can use your own style and images so long as you implement all the features.

Your implementation must look as good on mobile as it does on desktop, even if the original theme is shitty on mobile

Deadlines:

Commit to one per week until it’s done. You can claim three ‘extensions’ where for any theme, You can add an extra extension week, no questions asked.

Frenzy rule: You can claim one week off after the frenzy, not one week per extra one you did in the frenzy. So if you do 5 next weekend, you can skip the next week, not the next 5 weeks.
